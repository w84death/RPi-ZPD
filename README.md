# Raspberry Pi - Zero Photography Device

The **RPi-ZPD** is a very small device to make photos and 2K timelapse videos.

## History

It is a third iteration of this idea. To make a small, portable, Pi-powered camera. Instead of viewfinder I just need a simple screen to change settings and see progress of making photo(s).

I needed just two modes: single photo and timelapse interval shooting.

## Hardware


- Raspberry Pi Zero in Rainbow case
- Infrared Camera Module 5MP
